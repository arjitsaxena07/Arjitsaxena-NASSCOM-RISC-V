# Digital Logic With TL Verilog & Makerchip 
## 1) Combinational logic in TL Verilog using Makerchip 
### Lec 1. Introduction to Logic Gates

## *Summary:* 
In this first lecture, I’ve begun exploring the most fundamental part of any digital system—logic gates. These gates are the basic building blocks of digital electronics and perform Boolean operations like AND, OR, and NOT. Even though they look simple at first, they form the foundation of everything from simple decision-making circuits to the complex ALUs and control logic inside modern processors.

### Lec 2 Combinational Circuit

## *Summary:* 
In this lecture, I learned about combinational circuits, which are a step up from basic logic gates. These are digital circuits where the output depends only on the current inputs — there's no memory involved, so the behavior is purely input-driven.

Using the logic gates I studied earlier (AND, OR, NOT, XOR, etc.), I built more complex circuits like adders, multiplexers, and comparators. Each of these circuits performs a specific task by combining gates in clever ways.

Here’s what defines a combinational circuit:
1. No clock or timing elements
2. No feedback loops or storage
3. Deterministic output based on current input values

Examples I Explored:
**Half Adder**: Adds two bits and gives a sum and carry output.
**Full Adder**: Handles three bits (two inputs + carry-in).
**Multiplexer**: Selects one of many inputs based on control signals.
